Hi! My name is Romain Tartière, I am a _Free Software mercenary_.  I live in French Polynesia where I enjoy coconuts, I love things from the 70's (like [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) and [Japanese hard-rock music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_rock#1970s_to_1980s:_Diversification)) and am found of mixology :tropical_drink:.

I contribute to Free / Libre / Open Source software on a daily basis, with contributions to dozens and dozens of pieces of software.  My activity bellow shows a part of it, but keep in mind that GitHub is not the only place where you can contribute to Free Software.

### Projects I am actively working on

* [FreeBSD](https://freebsd.org), as a ports maintainer for [my own ports](https://portscout.freebsd.org/romain@freebsd.org.html) and the [puppet@ ones](https://portscout.freebsd.org/puppet@freebsd.org.html);
* [Puppet](https://puppet.com/), while I am not working for Puppet, I have been using it for years and regularly contribute to the various components composing the Puppet Platform;
* [Choria](https://choria.io/), by extension, while I am not working for Choria, my previous experience with Marionette Collective led me to Choria when it was dropped-off the Puppet Platform.

### Get in touch
